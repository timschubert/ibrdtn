With this command you could install all required and optional packages.

  libcurl4-gnutls-dev libdaemon-dev automake autoconf pkg-config libtool libcppunit-dev \

  libusb>=1.0.21 (for usb convergence layer)

### Compilation with debugging symbols ###

The old "--enable-debug" option has been removed. To compile the whole
code with debugging symbols use the additional CXXFLAGS with configure.

./configure CXXFLAGS="-ggdb"
make
